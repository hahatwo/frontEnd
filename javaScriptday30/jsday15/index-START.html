    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    var players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    var temp = players;
    console.log(temp);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    temp.push('wanghang');
    temp[1] = 'miss zhao';
    console.log(players);


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    var array = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < players.length; i++){
        array.push(players[i]);
    }
    array.push('nothing');
   // console.log(array, players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    var temp2 = players.slice();
    temp2[2] = 'bitch';
   // console.log(temp2, players);
    var temp3 = players.concat(players);
    temp3[0] = 'hello';
    console.log(temp3, players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    };

    const other = person;
    other.name = 'wanghang';
    console.log(other, person);


    // and think we make a copy:
    const other1 = Object.assign({}, person, {test: "test"});
    console.log(other1, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
